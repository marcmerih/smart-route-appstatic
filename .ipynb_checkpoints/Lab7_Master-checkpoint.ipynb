    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will be investigating optimization techniques, namely linear program-\n",
    "ming and integer programming for modelling and solving decision-making problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "Optimization, as it is studied within the field of operations research (OR), is an example of prescriptive analytics. Instead of inferring predictions, you are prescribing a best course of action for a given decision-making problem. Traditional optimization problems are modelled with a vector $\\bf{x}$ of decision variables (that represent some decisions to be made to solve the problem), an objective function $f(\\bf{x})$ to optimize, and a feasible set $\\mathcal{X}$ defined by problem constraints. \n",
    "\n",
    "A generic optimization problem can be expressed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "        minimize \\quad    & f(\\bf{x}) \\\\\n",
    "        subject \\ to \\quad        & \\bf{x} \\in \\mathcal{X}.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimization problems can be categorized into two main types:\n",
    "* **Convex Problems:** When the objective function $f(\\bf{x})$ is a convex function and the feasible set $\\mathcal{X}$ is a convex set. Traditional linear programming (LP) formulations fall within this category. Optimal solutions can be determined in polynomial $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ time; these problems are considered 'easy' to solve.\n",
    "* **Non-convex Problems:** When one of the above conditions are not satisfied. Traditional \\textit{integer programming} (IP) formulations fall into this category. Determining an optimal solution is an $\\mathcal{NP}$-Hard problem; these are 'hard' problems. _Note:_ For more information on computational complexity (not required for this laboratory), consult: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity\n"

    "## Linear Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modelling.** The first optimization technique we focus on in this lab is linear programming (LP). A linear program can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "        \\min_{x} \\quad    & \\sum_{j=1}^n c_j x_j \\\\\n",
    "        s.t. \\quad           & \\sum_{j=1}^n a_{i,j} x_j \\leq b_i, \\quad \\forall i \\in \\left\\{ 1,\\dots,m \\right\\}\\\\\n",
    "\t\t\\quad & x_j \\geq 0,  \\quad \\forall j \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the objective is a linear function and the constraints are linear inequalities. We can equivalently rewrite the above linear program in matrix notation as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "        \\min_{\\bf{x}} \\quad    & \\bf{c}^T \\bf{x} \\\\\n",
    "        s.t. \\quad           & \\bf{A} \\bf{x} \\leq \\bf{b} \\\\\n",
    "\t\t\\quad & \\bf{x} \\geq \\mathbf{0}.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "All LPs can be written in the above notation, known as inequality form. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Solving.** To solve the above formulation (i.e. find values for $\\bf{x}$ that minimize the cost function), solvers typically use the simplex method or interior point method. The simplex method conducts a local search over the extreme points of the polytope defined by the linear equalities of the formulation (remember pivot tables in $2^{nd}$ year?). The interior point method is a polynomial-time algorithm that traverses the interior of the polytope to find the optimal solution\\footnote{The details surrounding these will not be covered in lab - for more info, consult: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex\\_algorithm}. LP solvers require a user to enter the problem in some variation of inequality form; this will be discussed further in later sections of the lab."

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Integer Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modelling.** The second optimization technique we focus on in this lab is \\textit{integer programming} (IP). An IP formulation is very similar to an LP, the primary difference being that the decision variables $\\bf{x}$ are constrained to be positive integer valued. If all variables are integer, the formulation is considered an IP. If some variables are integer and some are continuous, it is considered a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation. In practice, most IPs are MILPs. \n",
    "We can express an IP as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "        \\min_{x} \\quad    & \\sum_{j=1}^n c_j x_j \\\\\n",
    "        s.t. \\quad           & \\sum_{j=1}^n a_{i,j} x_j \\leq b_i, \\quad \\forall i \\in \\left\\{ 1,\\dots,m \\right\\}\\\\\n",
    "\t\t\\quad & x_j \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+},  \\quad \\forall j \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solving.** Due to the integrality of the variables, solving IPs to optimality is an $\\mathcal{NP}$-Hard problem. State-of-the-art techniques use enumerative search within a branch-and-bound framework. _Note:_ For more information on branch-and-bound: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch\\_and\\_bound}, often improved with the help of cutting planes. The bounding mechanism helps the algorithm avoid exploring the entire search space. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm:** The steps involved in the branch-and-bound algorithm are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Formulate the problem as an IP.\n",
    "* Relax the integrality constraints on the problem variables and solve the resulting LP formulation (using simplex/interior point). This is the root node of the branch-and-bound.\n",
    "* Assess the solution of the root node:\n",
    "    * **If** all solution variables are integral, the problem is solved. **End.**\n",
    "    * **Else if** any solution variables are non-integral, select one of them to branch on (add $\\leq$ and $\\geq$ inequalities forcing towards integrality). This branching produces two child nodes (one for each inequality) in the branch-and-bound tree.\n",
    "* Solve the LP formulation for each of the child nodes. Assess the solutions: \n",
    "    * **If** either child node solution is integral, post this as an incumbent solution. If the solution value is better than the other child node, the other node is bounded (i.e. doesn't need to be branched on) and the problem is solved. **End.** \n",
    "    * **Else if** neither child node solution is integral, branch on each of the child nodes producing another layer in the tree. \n",
    "* This process is continued until an integral solution is proved to have the best possible objective value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice branch-and-bound using LP as the relaxation technique is able to solve reasonably sized problems while avoiding complete enumeration of the search space. However, the algorthm is still exponential time ($\\mathcal{O}(2^n)$, see complexity theory Wiki link from earlier if curious) and for some problems may take a very long time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some things to remember about branch-and-bound for solving IPs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Nodes: Linear programming relaxations are solved at each node, yielding a solution (consisting of variable values and an objective function value). To solve an IP, we essentially solve a series of progressively (and intelligently) more constrained LPs!\n",
    "* Branches: Inequalities are added during the branching process to force fractional variables away from the value they took in the LP solution.\n",
    "* Bounding: Avoid complete enumeration by bounding a node. If we prove the best solution does not lie beneath that node, we don't have to explore it."

You have one (or more) knapsacks, a set of items that you wish to store in them, and a set of weights and values associated with the items. The problem looks to find the optimal allocation of items to knapsack(s) to maximize the value of the items stored. The figure below illustrates the essence of a single knapsack problem.\n",

It essentially looks to find a route for a salesman through a set of cities such that: i) the salesman's travel distance is minimized, ii) he starts and ends at the same city, and iii) he never visits the same city twice (except for the beginning one).\n",

This route was 13,699 miles in length (although not optimal as he used a metaheuristic instead of a complete branch-and-bound).\n",

We also introduce variable $u_i$ to be the position in the sequence that city $i$ is visited (i.e., $u_2 = 3$ indicates the second city is visited third). We let $c_{ij}$ be the cost of this segment being traveled (i.e., the distance). The IP formulation is then given by:\n",
