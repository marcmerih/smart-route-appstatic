# Smart Route Appstatic

The team will build a novel route-based recommender that will optimize the travel experience and travel route preferences for car occupants and increase occupant awareness of their surroundings (e.g., by making them aware of tourism, event, and other exploration opportunities relevant to the preferences of the car occupants). The recommender will require collection of travel, tourism, and business data from a variety of sources and integration with an AI-based backend that can efficiently plan the route taking into account available data, user preferences, and system objectives.

# Client Expectations

The team will develop an interactive map-based front-end tool with a Python-powered backend that stores all data and powers the machine learning and AI-based models to serve front-end requests. The team will provide an interactive planning tool and either a simulated or real-time tool for use enroute. Ideally, students will validate the tool through a small user study designed to assess satisfaction of project requirements.
